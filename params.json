{"name":"San Francisco Startup Atlas","tagline":"","body":"#San Francisco Startup Atlas\r\n###WARNING: THIS APPLICATION IS POPULATED WITH TEST DATA\r\nThe application has been designed to illustrate functionality and has been populated with invented data and relationships to accomplish this purpose. While CrunchBase data and City of San Francisco location data has served as a starting point, the data in the application differs from these starting sources significantly (and not in a good way!).\r\n\r\n###Testing the application\r\n####Launching the application\r\nLaunch the application using JettyRunner: http://localhost:8080/search\r\n\r\nThe application uses Google Maps, and the Google API key will only permit access when using the above address.\r\n\r\n####Test queries\r\nThe application will only produce results on exact matches.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get test data is to start off by querying a San Francisco zipcode where there happen to be many startups. PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THE DATA AND RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT IN ANY WAY ACCURATE.\r\n\r\nHere are some sample search terms for which the database has information:\r\n- Startup Name Searches\r\n  - Zynga\r\n  - AKQA\r\n  - Twitter\r\n\r\n- Investor Name Searches\r\n  - AdTonik\r\n  - Aduro Advisors\r\n  - Aedeas Group\r\n  - AGC\r\n\r\n- Zipcode Searches\r\n  - 94103\r\n  - 94107\r\n  - 94114\r\n\r\n- Searches on Individuals\r\n  - Andrew Kent\r\n  - Steven Willmott\r\n  - Patrick\tSullivan\r\n\r\n##Introduction\r\nThe San Francisco Startup Atlas is a web application that tracks startup activity in San Francisco by plotting the location of startup companies on a map of the city. The intent is to illuminate the nexus between startups as logical/financial entities and their physical manifestations in terms of office space.\r\n\r\n###Interface\r\nThe application provides a simple interface that allows searching for startup companies based on a variety of criteria. The results are plotted on a Google map. Information on particular startups can be viewed by clicking on its map icon.\r\n\r\n![Web Interface](San-Francisco-Startup-Atlas.png)\r\n\r\n###Information accessible via the Atlas\r\nIn addition to physical location, the application provides details regarding each startup's funding. The names of principals, founders, and investors can also be used as a starting point for searches.\r\n\r\n###Historical information\r\nThe application contains data on past startups as well as present-day startups.\r\n\r\n###Intended use\r\nThe San Francisco Startup Atlas is intended to serve two primary purposes:\r\n- Assisting those who, for practical reasons, are interested in the physical dimensions of San Francisco's startup scene: local tourists, job-seekers, or residents of San Francisco wanting to know more about their neighbors\r\n- Providing those who may have no practical need for the data with a tool that will prove mildly diverting for the period of an extended sojourn to the restroom\r\n\r\n###Foundational use-cases\r\nThe following are some core use-cases around which the San Francisco Startup Atlas is being developed:\r\n\r\n1. You go out one morning and find that the run-down warehouse on the corner is suddenly blanketed in trendy landscaping and surveillance cameras. By punching in the zipcode you should be able to quickly determine whether you have a new startup on your hands, or just another grow-op.\r\n2. You are looking for a new gig and have heard of a company called Zynga. You want to be able to see where in the city they are located.\r\n3. You hear of a new venture capital firm and are interested in seeing how widely they have invested with startups in San Francisco.\r\n4. You meet an entrpreneur/founder who says he has been involved with lots of startups. You are interested in seeing exactly which startups he has been involved with and where in the city.\r\n\r\n###Motivation\r\nThis application is being developed as a class project for cs333 at University of San Francisco, taught by EJ Jung.\r\n\r\n##Technology Overview\r\nThe San Francisco Startup Atlas is built with the following technology components:\r\n- [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)\r\n- Web front-end:\r\n  - [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/)\r\n  - [BootStrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)\r\n- [PostgreSQL database](http://www.postgresql.org/)\r\n\r\n#The San Francisco Startup Atlas Database\r\n##Data Sources\r\nSome of the data used by The San Francisco Startup Atlas has been extracted from [CrunchBase](https://www.crunchbase.com/). Taken as a whole, the data consists of approximately 10,000 records. Approximately one quarter of the database entries represent startup companies, with the rest representing funding entities, details on funding rounds, addresses, and individuals.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone at [CrunchBase](https://www.crunchbase.com/) for making this data publicly available!\r\n\r\nAddress and geolocation information has been extracted from data made available by the city of San Francisco.\r\n\r\n##Database Structure\r\n\r\n###Entity Relationship Diagram\r\n![ERD](ERD.png)\r\n\r\n###Relational Schema\r\n![Schema](schema.png)\r\n\r\n###Indexes\r\nAs data is entered into the database irregularly and by batch, speed of lookup is the primary driver for indexing.\r\n\r\nMost lookups for this application are equality lookups: we are searching for specific startups that meet certain criteria, then populate their attributes based on equality relationships. For this reason most indexes will be hash indexes. The exception here is with regards to addresses and people: columns in these tables are indexed using B+ tree indexes to facilitate range searches.\r\n\r\nThe database used for this application is PostgreSQL, which automatically indexes all primary keys and all columns with unique constraints. The default PostgreSQL indexing method is B+ tree. By default, PostgreSQL's automatic indexing is not be case insensitive. The 'citext' extension has been applied to the database so that these indexes will behave in a case-insensitive manner, and all text fields have been defined as citext.\r\n\r\n####Index costs\r\n- B+ Tree Index (PostgreSQL default)\r\n  - Equality Search: D(1+logF 0.15B)\r\n  - Range Search: D(LogF 0.15B + number of matching records)\r\n- Hash Index\r\n  - Equality Search: 2D\r\n  - Range Search: BD\r\n\r\n###Table sizes\r\n- addresses (83,609 records)\r\n- employed_at (7,835 records)\r\n- funding_rounds (13,560 records)\r\n- investors (401 records)\r\n- located_at (2,225 records)\r\n-

longitude (B+ tree)\r\n\r\n- located_at\r\n  - startup (hash)\r\n\r\n- people\r\n  - first_name (B+ tree)\r\n  - last_name (B+ tree)\r\n  - alma_mata (B+ tree)\r\n\r\n- employed_at\r\n  - name
